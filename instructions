The python libraries used include:
flask
sqlite
datetime
pandas

readfile.py
the py script connects to an existing SQLite database, if the database isnt found it creates one.
after the connection has been made successfully, it checks for an existing LOG table,if one isnt found it creates one.
After then the csv file (task_file.csv) is read and converted into a dataframe by using pandas library and the dataframe is then inserted into the created databse.

server.py:
this py script starts a web application with its main end point shows the data by collecting them from the database
The HTML page displays the data and is generated dynamically with the help of a py library called JINJA2 template
A log is saved into the database table "logs" to the web application any time 
any request is made

Instructions
cd in the folder, then run readfile.py
then run server.py then open http://0.0.0.0:5000/ on your default browser
The page shows the data in a table. Any time the page is accessed it will create another log entry which can be seen by addind /logs to the local IP (http://0.0.0.0:5000/logs)
