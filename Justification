Python libraries i used:
SQLite
Pandas 
flask


SQLite is a database that is built in Python and it's used as the database because it does not require a seperate server process and allows accessing the database using a non standard variant of the SQL query language
Pandas is used to read the csv file because it offers data structure and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It can also be used for further development if any changes needs to be made to the database
flask is used to create the web application because it is a microframeworks and its templating features helps in displaying the data dynamically.
I used this libraries because i work with them often in relation to data science and i have a decent knowledge in the way they work
